              ZCoder, Ornisoftâ€™s flagship product is an Application Development
              Enhancement Utility that generates 80-90% of the total source code
              required for a Database Application in almost all the current
              technologies. Quite simply, it is a multiplatform ML (AI) based
              application that does majority of the coding work for you in a bug
              free and swift manner. A realisation of a beautiful dream that
              began 8 years ago, ZCoder stands apart in every way when compared
              with other code generators that are commonly used around the world
              today. ZCoder allows a programmer to generate templates for a web
              based or mobile based application in the language he/she prefer
              thereby significantly reducng the time taken to complete a
              project. It not only makes his/her work easy and fast, but also
              results in error free coding hence, giving the coder confidence to
              even take on complicated projects that were otherwise beyond
              his/her realm of expertise.
